                <h2>Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)</h2>
                <p>Trees and other plants are great at capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and using them for photosynthesis.     Unfortunately, there are not enough of them to handle the job due to rapid deforestation. We’re also not planting fast enough to   replenish the forests we have lost. 
                 Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is one of the best solutions to plug this gap. The idea is to capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial facilities and either reuse or store them for later use. Various products can be derived from recaptured carbon, including concrete and carbon fiber.  <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/ccus-in-clean-energy-transitions/a-new-era-for-ccus#growing-ccus-momentum">Read More..</a></p>

                <h2>Electric Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Since the 1990s, the transportation sector has been the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 28 percent of total GHG emissions. These emissions are evaluated based on three categories: tailpipe, well-to-wheel, and cradle-to-grave. 
                    All-electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are seen as the best solution to reduce the carbon footprint of conventional transportation systems and mitigate the effects of climate change. As they run on electricity, electric vehicles produce less to zero tailpipe emissions compared to their gasoline-powered counterparts.  <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/luke-tonachel/study-electric-vehicles-can-dramatically-reduce-carbon-pollution-transportation">Read More..</a></p>

                <h2>Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
                <p>Each year, global energy use increases, driving the need for more fossil fuels. To reduce our dependence on these energy sources, a growing number of businesses are engineering cleaner alternatives from inexhaustible sources that don’t release carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
                    Solar and wind power are two of the most common and inexpensive options. Solar panels, in particular, are now produced on a mass scale, making them accessible to consumers. Geothermal, tidal, hydropower, and biomass are other renewable sources that are proven equally effective in producing energy but are yet to be implemented at scale.  <a href="https://sustainablereview.com/dispelling-common-myths-about-fossil-fuel-costs/">Read More..</a></p>

                <h2>Plastic waste can be used in road construction</h2>
                <p>The idea of using waste plastics in road construction is relatively new. Laboratory tests have shown positive results when a small amount (5-10% by weight) of plastic is incorporated in bituminous mixes (asphalt), resulting in improved pavement stability, strength, and durability. However, international field experience using plastics in actual road construction is quite limited. In this review, we found examples of waste plastics being used in road construction in a few case studies in India, UK, Netherlands, Ghana, Ethiopia and South Africa. While roads constructed using waste plastics have shown good longevity and pavement performance to date, the first roads constructed using this technology are only about ten years old, so long-term outcomes are not yet clear.  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336563144_Using_waste_plastics_in_road_construction">Read More..</a></p>
