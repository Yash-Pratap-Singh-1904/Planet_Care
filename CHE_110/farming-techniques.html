            <p class="description">
                Sustainable farming system doesnâ€™t have to be only organic agriculture.<br>There are more methods that overlap in many principles that are sustainable in the long-run and may be 100 percent organic or at least from the biggest part.<br>The following ten sustainable farming methods and practices are just a few examples of the many ways that we can achieve a much more sustainable agriculture.

                    <h3><u>Permaculture</u></h3>
                    <p>Permaculture is a design system that applies principles that are found in nature to the development of human settlements, allowing humanity to live in harmony with the natural world. Permaculture principles and ethics can be applied to almost any area of living, including local economies, energy systems, water supplies, housing systems, and food production.<br>Permaculture design techniques include herb spirals, hugelkultur garden beds, keyhole and mandala gardens, sheet mulching, growing grain without tillage, each plant serving multiple purposes, and creating swales on contour to hold water high on the landscape.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Learn More..</a></p>

                    <h3><u>Hydroponics and aquaponics</u></h3>
                    <p>These innovative farming techniques involve the growing of plants without soil, nourishing the plants through specialized nutrients that are added to water.In hydroponic systems, crops are grown with the roots directly in a mineral solution or with the roots in an inert medium like gravel or perlite.Aquaponics combines the raising of aquatic animals (such as fish) with the growing of hydroponic crops. In aquaponic systems, the water containing the waste material from the aquaculture fish is used to nourish the hydroponic plants. After the water is used by the plants, the water is then recirculated back into the system to be reused by the fish.Both hydroponic and aquaponic systems are available in a variety of scales, from small home-scale systems to commercial-scale systems.<br><a href="https://greentumble.com/how-hydroponic-farms-could-save-the-world">Learn More..</a></p>

                    <h3><u>Polycultures and crop rotation</u></h3>
                    <p>Polyculture farming involves growing multiple crop species in one area. These species are often complementary to each other and aim at producing greater diversity of products from one plot while fully utilizing available resources. High biodiversity makes the system more resilient to weather fluctuations, promotes balanced diet and applies natural mechanisms to preserve soil fertility.Crop rotation is based on growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. The planned rotation may vary from a growing season to a few years or even longer periods. It is one of the most effective agricultural control strategies that is used in preventing the loss of soil fertility.<br><a href="https://greentumble.com/10-benefits-of-crop-rotation">Learn More..</a></p>
